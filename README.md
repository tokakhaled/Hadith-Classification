# Hadith-Classification
Hadith Level Classification
#### hadith dataset labeled manully with hadith level as (سهل و صعب ) then the NLP techniques employed to perform tasks such as 
- text preprocessing 
-  feature extraction
-  and building machine learning model. 
#### Text preprocessing involves tasks like
- tokenization,
- stemming, 
- and removing stopwords 
to clean and prepare the Hadith texts for further analysis.
#### Feature extraction techniques may be used in future to represent the textual data in a format that is suitable for machine learning algorithms.
